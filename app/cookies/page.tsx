              <p>
                This Cookie Policy explains how Rona Workforce Management System ("we", "us", and "our") uses cookies
                and similar technologies to recognize you when you visit our website. It explains what these
                technologies are and why we use them, as well as your rights to control our use of them.

              <p>
                Cookies are small data files that are placed on your computer or mobile device when you visit a website.
                Cookies are widely used by website owners in order to make their websites work, or to work more
                efficiently, as well as to provide reporting information.
              </p>
              <p>
                Cookies set by the website owner (in this case, Rona) are called "first-party cookies". Cookies set by
                parties other than the website owner are called "third-party cookies". Third-party cookies enable
                third-party features or functionality to be provided on or through the website (e.g., advertising,
                interactive content, and analytics). The parties that set these third-party cookies can recognize your
                computer both when it visits the website in question and also when it visits certain other websites.

              <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold">3. Why do we use cookies?</h2>
              <p>
                We use first-party and third-party cookies for several reasons. Some cookies are required for technical
                reasons in order for our website to operate, and we refer to these as "essential" or "strictly
                necessary" cookies. Other cookies also enable us to track and target the interests of our users to
                enhance the experience on our website. Third parties serve cookies through our website for advertising,
                analytics, and other purposes.

              <p>
                You have the right to decide whether to accept or reject cookies. You can exercise your cookie rights by
                setting your preferences in the Cookie Consent Manager. The Cookie Consent Manager allows you to select
                which categories of cookies you accept or reject. Essential cookies cannot be rejected as they are
                strictly necessary to provide you with services.
              </p>
              <p>
                If you choose to reject cookies, you may still use our website though your access to some functionality
                and areas of our website may be restricted. You may also set or amend your web browser controls to
                accept or refuse cookies.
